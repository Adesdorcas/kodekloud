Looking for assignment algorithm:
31 Tasks at least duplicated
including 13 3+ and two 5 times assigned.
33 unique tasks
which gives total of 64 tasks

I hope this information will be useful for some of you. Additionally if u send me tasks I did not faced with points assigned to them I will update this post to have complete list.
