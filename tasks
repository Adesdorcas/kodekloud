1) Create a Linux User with non-interactive shell?
A) adduser username -s /sbin/nologin
2) There are some specific access levels for users defined by system admins team of xFusionCorp Industries. Rather than providing some access levels to every user individually team has decided to create groups with required access levels and add users to that groups as needed. So there is a requirement as below:
a. Create a group named nautilus_developers in all App servers in Stratos Datacenter.
b. Add the user jarod to nautilus_developers in all App servers. (create the user if not present already)
A) 1  cat /etc/passwd
    2  groupadd  nautilus_developers
    3  sudo groupadd  nautilus_developers
    4  sudo useradd  jarod
    5  sudo usermod  -aG  nautilus_developers  jarod
    6  cat /etc/passwd
    7  id jarod
    8  history

3) During the monthly compliance meeting, it was pointed out that several servers in the Stratos DC do not have a valid banner. The security team has provided several approved template which should be applied to the servers to maintain compliance. These will be displayed to the user upon a successful login Update the message of the day on all application and db servers for Nautilus. Make use of the approved template located at /home/thor/nautilus banner on jump host?
A) 	scp /home/thor/nautilus_banner   tony@stapp01:/home/tony/
	sudo  -i
	cat  /home/thor/nautilus_banner >> /etc/motd
	service restart sshd
 	logout from thor
	login again then check banner..
	repeat steps for all app servers & db servers

4) There is a static website of Nautilus project running in Stratos Datacenter. Based on the infrastructure they have already configured app servers and code is already deployed over there. To make it work properly they need to configure LBR server. There are number of options for that but team has decided to go with HAproxy.
a. So install and configure HAproxy on LBR server and make sure all app servers are added to HAproxy load balancer. HAproxy must serve on default http port.
b. You can access the website on LBR link, to do so click on the + button on top of your terminal and select option Select port to view on Host 1 and after adding port 80 click on Display Port.
A)  	sudo yum update –y
      	sudo yum install haproxy
	sudo vi /etc/haproxy/haproxy.cfg
	add port no:80 in ---> frontend main *:80
	and add server details in --->  backend app section
	server stapp01 172.16.238.10:8084 check     ( here httpd port wil run on 8084)
	sudo systemctl restart  haproxy
	sudo systemctl status haproxy

5) On Nautilus storage server in Stratos DC there is a storage location /data which is used by different developers to keep their data (no confidential data). One of the developer siva has raised a ticket and asked for a copy of his/her data present in /data/siva directory on storage server. /home is an FTP location on storage server from where developers can download their data. Below are the instructions shared by system admin team to accomplish the task:
a. Make a siva.tar.gz compressed archive of /data/siva directory and move the archive to /home directory on storage server.
A)	 tar czvf siva.tar.gz /data/siva
	mv  siva.tar.gz /home

6) How To Change Runlevels In Centos7
A) To check default run levels in linux :  (default it is multi-user.target)
 	systemctl get-default
      to change run level to GUI 
	systemctl set-default graphical.target

7)  Production support team of xFusionCorp Industries is working on developing some bash scripts to automate different day to day tasks. One of them is to create a bash script for taking websites backup. They have a static website running on App Server 2 in Stratos Datacenter. They need to create a bash script named media_backup.sh which should accomplish below given tasks. (Also remember to place the script under /scripts directory on App Server 2)
a. Create a zip archive named xfusioncorp_media.zip of /var/www/html/media directory.
b. Save the archive in /backup/ on App Server 2. This is a temporary storage as backups from this location will be clean on weekly basis so we also need to save this backup archive on Nautilus Backup Server.
c. Copy the created archive to Nautilus Backup Server server in /backup/ location.
d. Please make sure script won't ask for password while coping the archive file also respective server user (for example tony in case of App Server 1) must be able to run it.

A)        create a Passwordless authentication from appserver to backup server.
 
	sudo vi media_backup.sh

	#!/bin/bash
	tar czvf  xfusioncorp_media.zip  /var/www/html/media
	mv xfusioncorp_media.zip   /backup/
	scp /backup/xfusioncorp_media.zip clint@stbkp01:/backup/

	chmod +x media_backup.sh








8) Create Basic+PAM authentication in Apache2?
A) 
 create Basic authentication first
 
https://www.server-world.info/en/note?os=CentOS_6&p=httpd&f=27

Create SSL certificates

https://www.server-world.info/en/note?os=CentOS_6&p=ssl

Configure httpd for SSL.

https://www.server-world.info/en/note?os=CentOS_6&p=httpd&f=5

Basic Auth + PAM

https://www.server-world.info/en/note?os=CentOS_6&p=httpd&f=12

9) set up a passwordless authentication from jump_host to all app servers in stratus_datacenter?
A) Create a ssh key in Jump_host thor server
 	ssh-keygen
     copy ssh key from thor server to all appservers
     ssh-copy-id tony@stapp01
     ssh-copy-id steve@stapp02
     ssh-copy-id banner@stapp03

10) There is a critical issue going on with Nautilus application in Stratos DC. Production support team has identified that application is not able to connect to database. After digging into the issue team found that mariadb service is down on database server.
Look into the issue and fix the same.
A) 	you need to try all below commands to find out error.
check the logs in
cat  /var/log/mariadb/mariadb.log
If you're running SELinux the following may help as well...
		chcon -R -v -u system_u -t mysqld_db_t /var/lib/mysql
change owner permissions
 chown -R mysql:mysql [mysql root folder]
check the status of mariadb 
	systemctl –l status mariadb
If you haven't any real data in your database then clear all in /var/lib/mysql.
After that try again to run command 
mysql_install_db --user=mysql --basedir=/usr --datadir=/var/lib/mysql to initialize database directory.
You need to run mysql_install_db to initialize MySQL data directory.

11) On our Storage server in Stratos Datacenter we are having some issues where nfsuser user is holding hundred of processes which is degrading the performance of server. So we have a requirement to limit its maximum processes. Please set its maximum process limits as below:
a. soft limit = 78
b. hard_limit = 95
A) cat /etc/security/limits.conf
	nfsuser  soft nproc 78
	nfsuser hard nproc 95


12) The production support team of xFusionCorp Industries has deployed some latest monitoring tools to keep an eye on every service, application etc running on the systems. One of the monitoring system reported about Apache service unavailability on one of the app server In Stratos DC.
Identify the faulty app host and fix the issue. Make sure Apache service is up and running on all app hosts. Also do not try to change the Apache port on any host.
A)  Check httpd is running on all servers are not
    	  sudo systemctl status httpd
      check httpd port is running or not 
       	netstat -ntpl
here port 80 is running on another service so we want to kill that process by using below command 
killall   sendmail(process name)

check status 
systemctl status httpd


13) We are having a backup management application UI hosted on Nautilus's backup server in Stratos DC. That backup management application code is deployed under Apache on backup server itself and Nginx is running as a reverse proxy on same server. Apache and Nginx ports are 8080 and 8092 respectively. We have iptables firewall installed on this server. Make the appropriate changes to fulfill the requirements mentioned below:
We want to open all incoming connections to Nginx's port and want to block all incoming connections to Apache's port. Also make sure rules are permanent.
A) 
    1 iptables -L
    2  iptables -A INPUT -p tcp --dport 8092 -j ACCEPT
    3  iptables -A INPUT -p tcp --dport 8082  -j REJECT
    4  iptables -L
    5  service iptables save

















IPtables Installation And Configuration

14) We have one of our website up and running on our Nautilus infrastructure in Stratos DC. Our security team has raised a concern that right now Apache’s port i.e 3002 is open for all since there is no firewall installed on these hosts. So we have decided to add some security layer for these hosts and after discussions and recommendations we have come up with below given requirements:
1.	Install iptables and all its dependencies on each app host.
2.	Block incoming port 3002 on all apps for everyone except for LBR host.
3.	Make sure the rules should persist even after system reboot.
A)  	To install iptables:
1.	Run the following command to install the iptables-service package from the CentOS repositories:
sudo yum install iptables-services
2.	Once the package is installed start the Iptables service:
sudo systemctl start iptables
sudo systemctl start ip6tables
3.	Enable the Iptables service to start automatically on system boot:
sudo systemctl enable iptables
sudo systemctl enable ip6tables
4.	Check the iptables service status with:
sudo systemctl status iptables
sudo systemctl status ip6tables
        5.     To check the current iptables rules use the following commands:
sudo iptables   -nvL
sudo ip6tables -nvL
iptables block access to port 3002 except from LBR host IP address:
iptables -A INPUT -p tcp --dport 3002 -s 172.16.238.14 -j ACCEPT
iptables -A INPUT -p tcp --dport 3002 -j DROP

check with LBR server:
login to LBR server check with appservers if it is reached or not 
curl 172.16.238.10:3002
curl 172.16.238.11:3002
curl 172.16.238.12:3002
 	Flush All Rules, Delete All Chains, and Accept All:  (if you want remove all rules in iptables)
		First, set the default policies for each of the built-in chains to ACCEPT. The main reason to do this is to ensure that you won’t be locked out from your server via SSH:
•	sudo iptables -P INPUT ACCEPT
•	sudo iptables -P FORWARD ACCEPT
•	sudo iptables -P OUTPUT ACCEPT
Then flush the nat and mangle tables, flush all chains (-F), and delete all non-default chains (-X):
•	sudo iptables -t nat -F
•	sudo iptables -t mangle -F
•	sudo iptables -F
•	sudo iptables -X
