Linux File Permissions
======================   
Some new requirements came up to automate a backup process that was done by xFusionCorp Industries system admins team manually earlier. To automate this task team has developed a new bash script xfusioncorp.sh. They have already copied the script on all required servers, however they missed to make it executable on one of the app server i.e App Server 1 in Stratos Datacenter.


Please give executable permissions to /tmp/xfusioncorp.sh script on App Server 1. Also make sure every user should be able to execute it.

    1  cd  /tmp/
    2  ls
    3  ls -la
    4  ls -l
    5  chmod +x xfusioncorp.sh
    6  sudo chmod +x xfusioncorp.sh
	sudo ./ xfusioncorp.sh
    7  ls -l
    8  cd
    9  history

Linux Run Levels
================
There are some new tools have been installed on app server in Stratos Datacenter. Some of these tools can only be managed from graphical interface. So there are some requirements came up for these app servers.


On all App servers in Stratos Datacenter change the default runlevel so that they can boot in GUI (graphical user interface) by default.

1  runlevel
    2  init 5
    3  systemctl status runlevel5.target
    4  sudo init $runlevel
    5  sudo vi /etc/init/rc-sysinit.conf
    6  cd /etc/inittab
    7  sudo vi /etc/inittab
    8  sudo systemctl get-default
    9  sudo vi /etc/inittab
   10  sudo systemctl get-default
   11  sudo vi /etc/inittab
   12  who -r
   13  init 5
   14  sudo init 5
   15  reboot
   16  systemctl isolate multi-user.target
   17  sudo systemctl isolate multi-user.target
   18  sudo systemctl list-units --type=target
   19  sudo systemctl isolate graphical.target
   20  sudo systemctl isolate runlevel5.target
   21  ls -l /usr/lib/systemd/system/runlevel5.target
   22  history
  23  runlevel
   24  echo $RUNLEVEL
   25  systemctl get-default
   26  sudo vi /etc/inittab
   27  sudo systemctl isolate graphical.target
   28  sudo systemctl get-default
   29  sudo systemctl set-default graphical.target
   30  sudo systemctl get-default
   31  history

   28 sudo systemctl get-default
   29  sudo systemctl set-default graphical.target
   30  sudo systemctl get-default
