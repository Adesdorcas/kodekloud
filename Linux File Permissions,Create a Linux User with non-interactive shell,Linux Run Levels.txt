Linux File Permissions
======================   
Some new requirements came up to automate a backup process that was done by xFusionCorp Industries system admins team manually earlier. To automate this task team has developed a new bash script xfusioncorp.sh. They have already copied the script on all required servers, however they missed to make it executable on one of the app server i.e App Server 1 in Stratos Datacenter.


Please give executable permissions to /tmp/xfusioncorp.sh script on App Server 1. Also make sure every user should be able to execute it.

    1  cd  /tmp/
    2  ls
    3  ls -la
    4  ls -l
    5  chmod +x xfusioncorp.sh
    6  sudo chmod +x xfusioncorp.sh
	sudo ./ xfusioncorp.sh
    7  ls -l
    8  cd
    9  history




Create a Linux User with non-interactive shell
==============================================

System admins team of xFusionCorp Industries has installed a backup agent tool on all app servers, as per tool's requirements they need to create a user with a non-interactive shell.


So create a user named ravi with a non-interactive shell in the app03 server.



    1  cat /etc/passwd
    2  adduser ravi
    3  sudo adduser ravi -s /sbin/nologin
    4  adduser ravi -s /sbin/nologin
    5  sudo  adduser ravi -s /sbin/nologin
    6  cat /etc/passwd
    7  history

sudo groupadd <groupname>
usermod -a -G <groupname> <username>  ---TO ADD USER TO GROUP
usermod -g <groupname> <username>  		--------		Change a User’s Primary Group {Note the -g here. When you use a lowercase g, you assign a primary group. When you use an uppercase -G , as above, you assign a new secondary group.}
usermod -a -G group1,group2,group3 exampleusername   --------    Add a User to Multiple Groups


Linux Services
===============

As per details shared by development team the new application release has some dependencies on back end. There are some packages/services need to be installed on all app servers under Stratos Datacenter. As per requirements please perform below given steps:


a. Install postfix package on all the application servers.

b. Once installed, make sure it is enabled to start during boot.


    1  sudo yum install postfix
    2  sudo systemctl start postfix
    3  sudo systemctl status postfix
    4  sudo systemctl -l status postfix
    5  sudo vi etc/hosts
    6  sudo vi /etc/hosts
1. Disable IPv6.
2. Comment the ipv6 entry in /etc/hosts file.
#::1         localhost localhost.localdomain localhost6 localhost6.localdomain6

    7  sudo systemctl restart postfix
    8  sudo systemctl status postfix
    9  sudo systemctl enable postfix
   10  sudo systemctl status postfix
   11  history

Linux Run Levels
================
There are some new tools have been installed on app server in Stratos Datacenter. Some of these tools can only be managed from graphical interface. So there are some requirements came up for these app servers.


On all App servers in Stratos Datacenter change the default runlevel so that they can boot in GUI (graphical user interface) by default.

1  runlevel
    2  init 5
    3  systemctl status runlevel5.target
    4  sudo init $runlevel
    5  sudo vi /etc/init/rc-sysinit.conf
    6  cd /etc/inittab
    7  sudo vi /etc/inittab
    8  sudo systemctl get-default
    9  sudo vi /etc/inittab
   10  sudo systemctl get-default
   11  sudo vi /etc/inittab
   12  who -r
   13  init 5
   14  sudo init 5
   15  reboot
   16  systemctl isolate multi-user.target
   17  sudo systemctl isolate multi-user.target
   18  sudo systemctl list-units --type=target
   19  sudo systemctl isolate graphical.target
   20  sudo systemctl isolate runlevel5.target
   21  ls -l /usr/lib/systemd/system/runlevel5.target
   22  history
  23  runlevel
   24  echo $RUNLEVEL
   25  systemctl get-default
   26  sudo vi /etc/inittab
   27  sudo systemctl isolate graphical.target
   28  sudo systemctl get-default
   29  sudo systemctl set-default graphical.target
   30  sudo systemctl get-default
   31  history

   28 sudo systemctl get-default
   29  sudo systemctl set-default graphical.target
   30  sudo systemctl get-default
