System admins team of xFusionCorp Industries has setup some scripts on jump host that run on some regular intervals and perform some operations on all app servers in Stratos Datacenter. To make these scripts work properly we need to make sure thor user on jump host has password less SSH access to all app servers through their respective sudo users. So based on the requirements:


Setup a passwordless authentication for user thor on jump host to all app servers through their respective sudo users.


step 1 =======
        ssh-keygen -t rsa

    Process.......
    Generating public/private rsa key pair.
    Enter file in which to save the key (/home/thor/.ssh/id_rsa): "leave empty"
    Enter same passphrase again: "leave empty"


step 2 =======
        ssh-copy-id tony@stapp01

    Process........
    /bin/ssh-copy-id: INFO: Source of key(s) to be installed: "/home/thor/.ssh/id_rsa.pub"
    The authenticity of host 'stapp01 (172.16.238.10)' can't be established.
    ECDSA key fingerprint is SHA256:yDN2aZLRxWdMSiFlBe05Fe2K0jLKb9+uMDL0z0Rlnv4.
    ECDSA key fingerprint is MD5:ee:7f:6f:72:a1:ae:76:b6:54:ee:bc:df:60:ad:04:c8.
    Are you sure you want to continue connecting (yes/no)? yes
    /bin/ssh-copy-id: INFO: attempting to log in with the new key(s), to filter out any that are already installed
    /bin/ssh-copy-id: INFO: 1 key(s) remain to be installed -- if you are prompted now it is to install the new keys
    
    tony@stapp01's password: "enter password for tony@stapp01"

    =   Number of key(s) added: 1

    Now try logging into the machine, with:   "ssh 'tony@stapp01'"
    and check to make sure that only the key(s) you wanted were added.

---IF THIS 3 ARE LOGIN WITHOUT ASKING PASSWORD YOUR TASK SUCCESS---
Repeat step 2 for......
        ssh-copy-id steve@stapp02
                    and
        ssh-copy-id banner@stapp03
