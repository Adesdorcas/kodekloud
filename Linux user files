There was some users data copied on Nautilus App Server 1 at /home/usersdata location 
by the Nautilus production support team in Stratos DC. 
Later they found that they mistakenly mixed up different user data there. 
Now they want to filter out some user data and copy it to another location. Find the details below:


==== TASK 1 ====
On App Server 1 find all files (not directories) owned by user anita inside /home/usersdata 
directory and copy them all while keeping the folder structure (preserve the directories path) 
to /news directory.


==== SOLUTION ====
1 ssh tony@stapp01
2 enter password
3 sudo su -      (change to root)
4 cd /home/usersdata, ll   -   list the files present
5 cd ...
6 enter the following:   find /home/usersdata -user anita | xargs cp --parents -t /news
7 cd ..
8 cd /news  -   check if directory has been created
9 ll        -   check the content
10 cd /home   -   you will see all content copied

VOILLA YOU ARE DONE !!!!
