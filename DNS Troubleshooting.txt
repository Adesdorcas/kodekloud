The system admins team of xFusionCorp Industries has noticed intermittent issues with DNS resolution
in several apps . App Server 1 in Stratos Datacenter is having some DNS resolution issues, 
so we want to add some additional DNS nameservers on this server.


As a temporary fix we have decided to go with Google public DNS. 
Please make appropriate changes on this server.


cd /etc/
ls
cat resolv.conf
sudo vi /etc/resolv.conf
    search stratos.xfusioncorp.com
    nameserver 127.0.0.0                     --ADD GOOGLE PUBLIC DNS - (nameserver 8.8.8.8 and nameserver 8.8.4.4
    nameserver 8.8.8.8
    nameserver 8.8.4.4
    options ndots:0
